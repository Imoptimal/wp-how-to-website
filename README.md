# wp-how-to-website

# Instructions:
- Install wordpress locally, using Local by Flywheel - PHP version must be > 7.4 (Simply Static plugin requires it).
- Adjust settings in admin dashboard:
  - Reading - discourage search engines from indexing
  - Discussion - check off "Allow people to submit comments on new posts"
  - Permalinks - rename category to "tutorials"; set custom structure to "/%category%/%postname%/"
- Add categories:
  - Plugin tutorial (slug: wordpress-plugin)
  - How to tutorial (slug: wordpress-topic)
- Install plugins:
  - Simply Static
  - RPD (my own)
- Run RPD three steps:
  - <b>NOTE:</b> After the second step, check json file folders for small files (aprox under 1 kb), and delete those with empty 'youtubeVideos' array, so the third step can run smoothly.
  - In the third step, choose to store all video per item (premium).
- Convert webiste to static using Simply static plugin (Set relative paths - avoiding issue with website resources).
- Upload here.
- Create 404.html file here on GitHub website, and populate it with needed elements. <br>
<b>NOTE! When updating repository, delete all static files except 404.html, CNAME, LICENSE and README.md, and the upload all of the static files generated by Simply Static!</b>
